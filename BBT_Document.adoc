= Application Logic Documentation


== 1. Application Logic Documentation

Every teacher has its own timeslots that they can setup. The timeslot is 25 min eg. if a teacher is available from 10 am to 11 am then it starts with 

* 10:00 - 10:25 
* 10:30 - 10:55
* 11:00 - 11:25
* 11:30 - 11:55

There can be multiple Teachers in same timeslots in that case we have a detailed logic for race conditional teacher selection.

| Weight | Rule | Condition | How to implement?

|10
|1
|Make sure there is an allocation of guaranteed classes of teachers.If there are same guarantees classes values of multiple teacher?  Select two paths and continue the parallel paths accordinly.
|If there are same guarantees classes values of multiple teacher?  Select two paths and continue the parallel paths accordinly.
Mike: 3 , Simon: 3 ? 

If there is a history of meeting where Simon teaches this users then Rule 2 overrides the Rule 1. 
Mike: 1 (guaranteed class) , Simon: 0 (Previous meeting) ? 

Double class or (n) number of classes sequence (25 minutes difference between old and new class)
Must always put old teacher as priority while selecting 
booking.

|Check if it  has sequential time and matching teacher with the same teacher otherwise go to the next rule.

|3
|Every teacher must get at least one class a day if they have a time slot.
|What if there are 5 teachers with no meetings in that day. 
Simon: 0 timeslot:10,  Karl: 0 timeslot:9, Stephen:0 timeslot:8, Levi:0 timeslot:8, Ram:0 timeslot:8 - Use the one that provides more available timeslot?

What there are 2 teachers with no meetings and both of them has equal free timeslots
Simon: 0 timeslots:10 , Karl: 0 timeslot:10
Create brand new path for both of the teacher.

|After every teacher has got class a day then we check their number of time slots as a priority to assign


|What if all the teachers has at least one class in that day.
Simon: 1 timeslot:10, Karl: 1 timeslot:9, Ram:1 timeslot:8 - Use the one that provides more available timeslot?

What if there are 2 teachers with already have at least one meeting booked and both of them has equal free timeslots
Simon: 2 timeslots:10 , Karl: 3 timeslot:10
2/10 ? 20%  , 3/10 : 30%
So the Simon must get the booking.


|3
|5
|Check the usage of timeslots of each teacher, the lower ones get the first priority
|What if there are multiple teachers who has similar timeslots and similar booking percentage.
Simon: 6 timeslots:20 , Karl: 3 timeslot:10
6/20 ? 30%  , 3/10 : 30%
here we create multiple path.

== 2. Meeting Lifecycle

Meeting has primarily 13 types of state:


* AVAILABLE

This is the first state where every timeslot created by Teacher gets pre-set with this State. Also this state does not contain any student data because it is only for teacher data.

* PRE_SCHEDULED
* RE_SCHEDULED
* SCHEDULED

Scheduled one is state for booked meeting which has confirmed student and its timeslot gets reserved

* COMPLETED

This meeting is for the completed meeting successfully without any problem. Normally this means the teacher gets fully paid and student gets debited by x number of coins.

* CANCELLED

this is the stage where class is canceled by the admin or teacher,class can be canceled for premium coin only by teacher . 

* WAITAPPROVAL
* REVIEW

This is a stage where the class is sent to admin in order to review.

* REFUNDED

Refunded is state where parent got the refund and the teacher got the penalty. 

* MISSED

This state represent that teacher was not there to take class on time.

* TRANSFERRED

This represent that the class is transfered from one teacher to another.

* REQUEST_TRANSFER

This status represent that the teacher has requested to transfer his class to other teacher. 

* DELETED

A meeting has its predefined rules for changing its state from  **SCHEDULED** to many different states as per the rules.

 

[cols="1,5,2,2"]

|Rule|Condition |From State |To State

|1
|Teacher joined meeting before 5 minutes of meeting start time student did not joined the meeting 
|SCHEDULED

|Student joined meeting after 5 min of start meeting
|SCHEDULED
|REFUNDED

|3
|Neighter student joined the meeting nor teacher 
|SCHEDULED
|REFUNDED

== 3. Coin Lifecycle

 Coin is a virtual currency in BigBigTutuor system. Every coin is representation of native currency value for a single class. Every coin has its state directly linked with the Meeting entity. A coin has been distinctly managed by two types:
    
* STANDARD
      
   Standard coin are the normal coin where the coin is simply  assigned to random teacher according to the booking algorithm
   
* PREMIUM
    
    Every premium coin has higher native currency value than the Standard Coin and this coin has a feature to select preferred Teacher from the Teacher list during the booking phase. 

Every coinâ€˜s native currency value is determined by Exchange rate and there can only be one exchange rate set for each coin. A coin has its own hash code which makes it unique and spendable to preferred user. The spend of coin is mathematically calculated by using Coin history data.  There are more than one history for each coin. 

## 4. Internal Application Architecture
   
Our application is built using single monolithic application using Quarkus Framework (Java). The application has its core component like
